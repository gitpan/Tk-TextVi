        Several errors in the POD are fixed (Gratia, Michal Spacek).

        Undo now works with insert mode and works a bit better with
        normal commands.

        Tested under Tk version 804.027 with no problems.  The required
        version has been reduced.

        The demo script is now correctly listed in Makefile.PL.
